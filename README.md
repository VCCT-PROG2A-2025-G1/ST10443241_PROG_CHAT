The bot responds to KEYWORDS, NOT WHOLE SENTENCES. There are the two main keywords and then the specific keywords it can provide info on.
This file will contain what keywords can be combined with what for cybersecurity answers.

1.What:
(Will give a definition)

	1.1.Cybersecurity
	1.2.Phishing
	1.3.Firewall
	1.4.Vpn

2.How:
(Will give a brief explanation)

	2.1.Cybersecurity
	2.2.Phishing
	2.3.Firewall
	2.4.Vpn

The bot is spelling sensitive, so it wont be able to understand if any of the keywords are misspelled.
